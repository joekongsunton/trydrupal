## Dumps

#### Goal
- Propose the dump of the db for the current commit
- Give two small Shell scripts to export and import the database "trydrupal"
- Locally, dumpDB.sh also create a copy of the latestdump which is dated and inserted into the "backups" folder, but this folder is ignored for versioning (see .gitignore)
